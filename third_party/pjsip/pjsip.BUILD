# PJSIP 2.14.1 — stripped down to SIP signalling + Opus audio only.
#
# What we keep vs remove:
#   KEEP    Opus                 — the codec used for high-quality wideband audio
#   KEEP    G.711 µ-law / A-law  — kept as fallback (priority set to 0 at runtime)
#   KEEP    pjmedia conference bridge + custom AudioMediaPort
#   KEEP    null audio device  — modem-server calls setNullDev(); no ALSA needed
#   REMOVE  ALSA / PortAudio   — --disable-sound → no libasound2 runtime dep
#   REMOVE  Speex AEC          -- we set ecTailLen = 0, so no echo canceller
#   REMOVE  GSM / Speex / iLBC / L16 / G.722 / G.722.1 codecs
#   REMOVE  OpenSSL / TLS
#   REMOVE  Video pipeline
#
# NOTE: --disable-libyuv and --disable-libwebrtc are intentionally omitted.
# Those flags cause `make install` to fail because build.mak unconditionally
# lists their .a paths in APP_THIRD_PARTY_LIB_FILES regardless of the flags.
# Using only --disable-video prevents use of those libs while keeping them
# compilable so the install step succeeds.
#
# PJSIP installs static libs with a platform-specific arch suffix, e.g.
#   libpjsua2-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.a
# The postfix_script creates symlinks without the arch suffix so that
# out_static_libs can use portable names.
